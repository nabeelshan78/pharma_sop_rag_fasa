# 5 PROCESS DESCRIPTION

# 5.1 General

Regular Periodic Quality Reviews (PQRs) of Finished Products and APIs must be conducted for products manufactured by Grünenthal and/or where Grünenthal acts as Marketing Authorization Holder, to verify the consistency of the existing process and the appropriateness of current specifications for both starting materials and finished products. Additionally, PQRs allow to identify product and process improvements, ensuring complete oversight on the quality of the medicinal product and safety of the patient.

The process flow (figure 1) describes the end-to-end process steps that must be followed when planning, creating, approving and executing the MAH review of PQRs. Compliance with applicable local legislations and existing agreements with license partners must be ensured.

# Figure 1: End-to end PQR Process

Overview of the Product Quality Review Process in Grünenthal

| End                  | Yes                             |

The responsibilities of each step of the PQR process are described in table 1 and depend on the following scenarios:

- All the manufacturing steps (including release) are performed by CMO
- The manufacturing steps are separated between CMO and Grünenthal manufacturing site(s)
- All the manufacturing steps (including release) are performed by Grünenthal site(s)

Whenever more than one entity is involved in the creation and review of the PQR (e.g. MAH is not the manufacturer, or manufacturing/testing is split between different manufacturing sites), a TQA must be in place between the various parties defining their respective responsibilities in producing the PQR.

# 5.2 Creation, Review and Approval of PQR Plans

Regular periodic quality reviews of all authorized medicinal products must be conducted and documented annually (unless differently specified and supported by risk assessment). An annual plan for PQR creation must be generated by the responsible department (see table 1).

The planning of PQR creation, approval and MAH review must consider the timelines outlined in 5.3 and 5.4 (see below). When applicable, the timelines must be adjusted to ensure timely provision of the PQR as agreed with suppliers and/or customers in the respective Technical Quality Agreements.

In case of products with manufacturing steps split between manufacturing sites, the IMQ department of the manufacturing site performing the last manufacturing step is the leading site and must coordinate the planning of PQR with the other affected IMQ department (in case of GRT site) or ESQ (in case of CMO).

The PQR plan must be created and approved by the responsible departments outlined in table 1 within the first quarter of each year. A PQR Plan template is provided in SUP-004779 “Product Quality Review Plan Template”. Any delays to the PQR Approval and MAH Review as stipulated in the PQR plan must be appropriately documented by a deviation (see PROC-004019 – “Global Process for Deviation Management”).

¹ When batch certification is done by ESQ QP, ESQ must create/approve the internal PQR




--- Page 7 ---


# 5.3 Creation, Review and Approval of PQRs

Products with similar composition (e.g. different strengths of a product) or a comparable production process, can be grouped and assessed together in one PQR. If so, common properties must be assessed together and specific features must be pointed out.

Whenever more than one manufacturing site is involved (internal or external) and batch certification is done by a GRT QP, the respective department/site in GRT responsible must:

- Coordinate the collection of the PQRs of the other manufacturing site(s)² and other annexes by GRT functions³
- Prepare a consolidated PQR report, including a “Summary and Conclusion” section, with reference to all annexes.

When performing the PQR review, if significant quality issues are identified for the first time, these must be evaluated and if necessary, documented in Grünenthal’s eQMS (MasterControl) and properly escalated.

Compiled PQRs must be reviewed/approved and stored as described in the WIN PROC-008741 “Managing PQRs in MasterControl” by the department(s) described in table 1 “PQR Process Responsibility Matrix”. Whenever batch certification is done by GRT QP, the responsible QP must be one of the approvers.

The department responsible for PQR approval, as described in table 1 “PQR Process Responsibility Matrix”, must notify CQA that approved PQRs are ready for MAH Review.

The tables below describe the timelines for the preparation, review and approval of the PQR by the respective Quality department (see table 1 – “PQR creation” and “PQR review and approval”). While the periods PQR delivery/creation are indicative, the date of the PQR approval (as outlined in the annual PQR plan) must be respected. When applicable, the timelines may be adjusted to respect agreements stipulated in Technical Quality Agreement with CMOs.

² Whenever a CMO is involved, the coordination with the CMO is done through ESQ

³ Annexes by other GRT functions include e.g. Annex 6 and 10 (Regulatory Affairs) (see SUP-013083 “Overview and Responsibilities of API and FP PQR Annexes”)

# 5.3.1 Content of Finished Product PQR

The PQR report must contain a comprehensive and systematic review of all aspects related to the quality of a Finished Product and/or API over a defined period. The templates outlined in SUP-004661 “Product Quality Review API (Template)” and SUP-004662 “Product Quality Review Finished Product (Template)” must be used to when creating the PQR for internally manufactured APIs and Finished Products. Annexes include the GRT and EU GMP regulatory requirements. If special requirements by customers or local regulations exist, these must be added and listed in the Table of Contents. Annexes must be signed outside of MasterControl.

The PQR report must include the sections described in the following table:

# 5.4 MAH Review and Amendment of PQRs

A MAH Review must be conducted for Finished Product PQRs and must take place within 20 working days after the PQR Approval. The MAH review must be documented in SUP-004663 “MAH Review (Template)” or, if required by local authorities, an alternative approved template.

The MAH is accountable for performing the MAH review, which includes an evaluation of:

- whether corrective and preventive action are required
- any revalidation should be undertaken
- PQR of in-country GMP activities (e.g. QC Testing) is needed
- Products from CMO: Annex 6 and 10 by GRT Regulatory Affairs is needed

4 If needed, SUP-004662 “Product Quality Review Finished Product (Template)” must be used. At least the changed annexes and a new summary and conclusion chapter must be added.




--- Page 10 ---


The MAH review must be performed by the relevant Commercial Quality Assurance of the sale affiliate/cluster⁵ of Grünenthal, when the sales affiliate is appointed as MAH of the product in the country.

If the QA representative (CQA) of the MAH identifies:

- any corrections/adjustments necessary to the relevant PQR report already approved
- any need for further CAPAs
- any need for revalidation

he/she is accountable to align this with the product releasing Qualified Person/equivalent function (or ESQ, when all manufacturing steps incl. batch release are done at CMO).

For CMO products, if Annex 6 and/or 10 are required, CQA must align this need with the responsible Regulatory Affairs department (responsible unit, as described in SUP-013083 “Overview and Responsibilities of API and FP PQR Annexes”. Annex 6 and 10 must be compiled with the MAH Review and become one single document.

Compiled MAH Review documents must be approved and stored as described in the WIN PROC-008741 “Managing PQRs in MasterControl” by the GDP-RP of the respective MAH (see table 1 “PQR Process Responsibility Matrix”).
