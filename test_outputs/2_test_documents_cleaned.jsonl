{"text": "# 5 PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\n# 5.1 General\n\nRegular Periodic Quality Reviews (PQRs) of Finished Products and APIs must be conducted for products manufactured by Grünenthal and/or where Grünenthal acts as Marketing Authorization Holder, to verify the consistency of the existing process and the appropriateness of current specifications for both starting materials and finished products. Additionally, PQRs allow to identify product and process improvements, ensuring complete oversight on the quality of the medicinal product and safety of the patient.\n\nThe process flow (figure 1) describes the end-to-end process steps that must be followed when planning, creating, approving and executing the MAH review of PQRs.
