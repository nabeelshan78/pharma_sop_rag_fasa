general 
regular periodic quality reviews (pqrs) of finished products and apis must be 
conducted for products manufactured by grünenthal and/or where grünenthal acts as 
marketing authorization holder, to verify the consistency of the existing process and the 
appropriateness of current specifications for both starting materials and finished products. 
additionally, pqrs allow to identify product and process improvements, ensuring
complete oversight on the quality of the medicinal product and safety of the patient. 
the process flow (figure 1) describes the end-to-end process steps that must be followed 
when planning, creating, approving and executing the mah review of pqrs. compliance 
with applicable local legislations and existing agreements with license partners must be

5.2
creation, review and approval of pqr plans
regular periodic quality reviews of all authorized medicinal products must be conducted 
and documented annually
(unless differently specified and supported by risk 
assessment). an annual plan for pqr creation must be generated by the responsible 
department (see table 1).
the planning of pqr creation, approval and mah review must consider the timelines 
outlined in 5.3 and 5.4 (see below). when applicable, the timelines must be adjusted to 
ensure timely provision of the pqr as agreed with suppliers and/or customers in the 
respective technical quality agreements. 
in case of products with manufacturing steps split between manufacturing sites, the imq 
department of the manufacturing site performing the last manufacturing step is the leading 
site and must coordinate the planning of pqr with the other affected imq department (in 
case of grt site) or esq (in case of cmo). 
the pqr plan must be created and approved by the responsible departments outlined in 
table 1 within the first quarter of each year. a pqr plan template is provided in sup-
004779 “product quality review plan template”. any delays to the pqr approval and 
mah review as stipulated in the pqr plan must be appropriately documented by a 
deviation (see proc-004019 – “global process for deviation management”).

respective responsibilities in producing the PQR.
5.2
Creation, Review and Approval of PQR Plans
Regular periodic quality reviews of all authorized medicinal products must be conducted 
and documented annually
(unless differently specified and supported by risk 
assessment). An annual plan for PQR creation must be generated by the responsible 
department (see table 1).
The planning of PQR creation, approval and MAH review must consider the timelines 
outlined in 5.3 and 5.4 (see below). When applicable, the timelines must be adjusted to 
ensure timely provision of the PQR as agreed with suppliers and/or customers in the 
respective Technical Quality Agreements. 
In case of products with manufacturing steps split between manufacturing sites, the IMQ 
department of the manufacturing site performing the last manufacturing step is the leading 
site and must coordinate the planning of PQR with the other affected IMQ department (in 
case of GRT site) or ESQ (in case of CMO). 
The PQR plan must be created and approved by the responsible departments outlined in 
table 1 within the first quarter of each year. A PQR Plan template is provided in SUP-
004779 “Product Quality Review Plan Template”. Any delays to the PQR Approval and 
MAH Review as stipulated in the PQR plan must be appropriately documented by a
