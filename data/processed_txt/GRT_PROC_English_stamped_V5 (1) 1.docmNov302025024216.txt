backup definitions
it is composed by “backup jobs” or “backup policies” where the configurations and settings 
are defined.
backup generation
backed-up data must be kept for well-defined time. the definition of a backup includes a 
decision how many backup generations to retain (may vary per system / application). the 
retained backups (corresponding to multiple points in time for restore) represent backup 
generations. backup generations are subject to aging (i.e. they will be automatically deleted 
at the end of the retention period).
backup media
backup media are mass storage media (e.g. clouds or disk storages) that are used to store 
backed-up data. 
backup schedule
besides the option to invoke a one-time backup (e.g. prior to planned changes on it 
systems), most backups run according to a defined schedule. the backup schedule is part 
of the backup definition.
backup tool
at grünenthal, multiple backup tools are in use. the choice of an appropriate backup tool 
to given backup requirements lies within the responsibility of the am backup.
backup window
for some applications, running backups will degrade the service quality of the application -
sometimes even an application downtime will be required for backup. with respect to this 
fact, the backup definition of such applications will include backup windows during which 
the backups are performed. the backup window is part of the backup definition.
full backup & incremental
backup
a full backup represents a complete copy of all data to be backed up to the backup media. 
to reduce backup media consumption, incremental backups only store data that has 
changed since the last backup. starting with one full backup multiple backup generations 
may be stored as incremental backups. 
data mirroring
enterprise level storage systems allow to copy storage data “on the fly” to a secondary 
storage system. every block of data that is written to the primary storage is mirrored 
immediately to a secondary storage system. 
at grünenthal, data mirroring is implemented to mitigate disaster scenarios (e.g. if the 
primary storage fails). in these scenarios, mirrored data on the secondary storage system 
can be activated. data mirroring cannot be regarded as a solution for backup & restore.
snapshots
in virtualized environments, data, complete servers or storage units can be subject of
snapshotting. when a snapshot is invoked, all current data in scope gets frozen. starting 
from that point in time, data changes (add, modify or delete) are stored to another place 
with references to the snapshotted data. on demand, snapshotted data can be reverted 
back to the point in time when the snapshot was taken.

to further enhance security, backup servers must be kept outside the corporate active 
directory domain. this isolation reduces the risk of lateral movement in case the 
domain is compromised, preserving the integrity of the backup infrastructure. it 
ensures that, even in the event of a ransomware attack or privilege escalation within 
the domain, the backup systems remain secure and accessible for recovery.
additionally, access logs must be enabled and monitored to detect and investigate any 
unauthorized activity. combining logical access controls with network segmentation 
and strong authentication mechanisms—such as multi-factor authentication—further 
strengthens the resilience of backup systems against both internal and external 
threats.
implementation of backup definitions
the am backup will implement backups according to backup service definitions as 
defined in 5.1 “default backup services” or 5.2 “defining individual backup services”. 
for any implemented backup definition, the am backup will check the successful 
completion of the first backup by default and troubleshoot backup problems, if 
necessary. this implementation is documented through the service request (if default 
services apply) or an it change is opened (if individual backup services apply).
after the first backup the am backup will restore a sample file (a random file or it can 
also be a notepad file “test” with date and time created by the am backup) and check 
the restore job for successful completion by comparing the restored sample file with 
the original file. this must be a task in the service request or in the it change.
backup monitoring
the am backup is responsible for monitoring the completion of all backups on every 
working day (monday to friday, except for public holidays). the monitoring system 
provides information and/or warnings regarding the backup result (passed/failed). in 
case of any failed backup, an incident in itsm (follow proc-002095) is created 
automatically and the application manager is notified. backup manager is required to 
analyze the cause of the failure and implement corrective measures (usually a 
repetition of the backup during the day). 
the application manager and the business process owner will evaluate if a quality 
event/deviation is needed to be raised, in compliance with gxp regulations.
managing secondary repository for backup media
as backup target, different storage media types are useable. if backup is performed 
onto suitable backup cloud storage, the backup tool automatically verifies backup data 
stored on the cloud (as part of the backup execution) and recognizes poor backup 
media. the am backup is responsible for maintaining the available space on the cloud 
(blob storage).
changes to backup definitions
if a change in existing backup definitions is required (e.g. a changed backup schedule 
or a pause of backup execution for planned application maintenance) the am or bpo 
needs to open a service request in itsm. if the system is gxp relevant, the am or bpo

the am backup will only restore data on explicit request by the user, am or bpo. a 
service request in itsm is required to start into the process of restore. the user, am
or bpo that identified the quality event/deviation must introduce the service request 
number as action item in quality management system. the restore operation must be 
documented in the service request through print screens or description.
in case if a gxp or critical system is restored, the application manager is responsible 
to verify and test the correctness of system functionality after the restore (e.g.  
validation activities). in case the restore fails, a roll back plan must be assessed case 
by case by the application manager together with am backup.

Service Request in ITSM is required to start into the process of restore. The User, AM
or BPO that identified the quality event/deviation must introduce the Service Request 
number as action item in Quality Management System. The restore operation must be 
documented in the service request through print screens or description.
In case if a GxP or critical system is restored, the Application Manager is responsible 
to verify and test the correctness of system functionality after the restore (e.g.  
validation activities). In case the restore fails, a roll back plan must be assessed case 
by case by the Application Manager together with AM Backup.
The following workflow chart shows the process in detail.

decommissioning of backup definitions
a service request in itsm is required to start into the process of decommissioning a 
system. the requestor (am, bpo) is responsible to issue the needed documentation 
(moc, risk assessment, any other) if the system under decommissioning is gxp 
relevant. when systems or applications are taken out of service the am backup will 
delete the backup definitions accordingly (this must be a task in the service request).
5.4
periodical restore tests for validated systems
for validated applications / systems, restore of data will be tested at least once per 
year for productive systems (no restore tests for non-production systems). gxp 
machines are listed in sup-011745. this list is updated with info present on the cmdb 
(reviewed once a year). the local am backup will restore sample data files and check 
the restore job for successful completion by comparing restored and original files. the 
am backup will inform the am about the results of the restore test. results are 
recorded using template sup-011708 and shared with the am. these documents are 
also attached to the it change opened to document the restore tests. these 
documents are checked during system periodic review – see proc-004035 and 
proc-007444.
however, these tests verify if the backup tool is working as intended. additional restore 
procedure that require data integrity checks, must be address by the am to the am 
backup through a service request in which am identifies the file or database that can

backup retention
backup generations are retained securely for the defined retention period according to 
the backup definitions – see: 5.1 “default backup services” and 5.2 “defining individual

spatial separation of original and backup data
backup data must be stored in a different geographic location than the original data
but remaining in a location compliant with local regulation, to assure all applicable data 
privacy requirements, including gdpr and hipaa. this means that data produced in 
europe shall remain in european union and european economic area, data produced 
in south america shall remain in south america market, and data produced in the
