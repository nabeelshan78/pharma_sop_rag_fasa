objective 
the objective of this procedure is to describe how to perform the check of compliance 
between gmp documentation and registration documentation.  
this procedure ensures that documentation related to manufacturing, testing (including 
stability studies), releasing activities on drug substances/products manufactured at 
grünenthal production sites or by cmos is in compliance with registration documentation 
approved by the relevant competent health authority. 
2 
scope 
the compliance check applies to drug substances, bulk and finished products 
manufactured by grünenthal or by cmos, for its own use or for customer business. 
the procedure describes the parts in the gmp documents which have to be checked for 
regulatory compliance with the related registration documents however due to site specific 
differences not all gmp exist / will be checked by each gqpm at each site.
