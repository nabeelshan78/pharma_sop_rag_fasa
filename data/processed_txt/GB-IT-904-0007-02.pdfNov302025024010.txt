5.1 
company e-mail  
• it is forbidden to forward your grünenthal work e-mail, either manually or by any 
automated means, to any private or external e-mail account.  doing so is deemed to 
be gross misconduct and anyone found to be in breach of this rule maybe liable for 
disciplinary action. 
• e-mail with information which is meant exclusively for grünenthal employees or of 
confidential nature must not be forwarded to any externals, third parties or private e-
mail accounts.  doing so will be a breach and will also lead to disciplinary action. 
• the grünenthal work e-mail account must exclusively be used to conduct the 
company’s business. 
• sending e-mails to everyone in the company or to a large collective e-mail group is 
the responsibility of the leadership team, hr, compliance and the it department 
which are authorised by the company to do so.  should a situation arise where an 
individual outside the functions mentioned above has to send an e-mail to the entire 
company, then they must seek the approval of a leadership team member before 
sending. 
• do not use the reply all option to reply to a company-wide communication.  doing 
so sends your reply to the entire company unnecessarily and is considered bad e-
mail etiquette.  if you do need to send a reply e-mail, then you should only reply to 
the individual who has sent the original email.  do not copy in the entire company. 
• avoid sending or forwarding e-mails containing pointless or questionable contents.  
• delete e-mails from unknown senders requesting personal information or payment 
for any outstanding invoice.  especially if these emails contain a document which 
you are required to open.  if you have any doubts and or the reliability of the sender 
cannot be guaranteed, then delete the e-mail.  these could be spam or phishing 
emails containing viruses or malware, such as ransomware, which can infect your 
computer system and render your files unusable.
