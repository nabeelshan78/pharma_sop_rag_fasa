5.2
process validation planning
process validation must follow an approved protocol which describes the planning of 
the validation activities, which includes the validation strategy and the respective 
applied validation approach (see chapter 5.2.2). 
for a successful pv, good planning is key and essential for activities such as:

determining the number of pv batches is necessary to demonstrate that 
acceptable control over the process has been achieved during the process 
validation studies. at least three consecutive batches per strength are used to 
validate a manufacturing process

giving instructions for the execution of pv in a protocol.

establishing the representative number of samples to assess process 
performance and to determine variability

developing clear specification of acceptance criteria and expectations for 
successful pv

evaluating data and test results obtained from pv (see chapter 5.3)

generating concise summary of test results, observations from pv batches, and 
a closure statement concluding the validation activity (see chapter 5.3)
5.2.1
sampling plan and acceptance criteria

Process Validation Planning
Process Validation must follow an approved protocol which describes the planning of 
the validation activities, which includes the validation strategy and the respective 
applied validation approach (see chapter 5.2.2). 
For a successful PV, good planning is key and essential for activities such as:

Determining the number of PV batches is necessary to demonstrate that 
acceptable control over the process has been achieved during the process 
validation studies. At least three consecutive batches per strength are used to 
validate a manufacturing process

Giving instructions for the execution of PV in a protocol.

Establishing the representative number of samples to assess process 
performance and to determine variability

Developing clear specification of acceptance criteria and expectations for 
successful PV

Evaluating data and test results obtained from PV (see chapter 5.3)

Generating concise summary of test results, observations from PV batches, and 
a closure statement concluding the validation activity (see chapter 5.3)

leveraged so that the plans are rigorous and practical.

2. stratified 
random 
sampling
it is possible with simple random sampling that, just by chance, the samples may 
not contain units from segments of the batch that are of interest. "for example, in 
process validation, the beginning and end of the batch may be of interest. so, 
although a simple random sample is statistically valid, one may not be satisfied 
with a sampling plan that does not include samples taken from the beginning or 
end of the batch."
a stratified sampling strategy partitions the batch into "strata," or groups, where 
differences may exist between the strata. the combination of all strata must cover 
the entire batch. then random sampling is performed within each stratum.
3. systematic 
sampling
"a systematic sampling strategy is performed by taking a sample(s) at equal 
intervals throughout the batch, typically based on the total number of units or 
manufacturing time. the first sample location is determined at random and then the 
remaining samples are taken at equal intervals."
5.2.2
process validation approaches
manufacturing processes can be validated by different approaches.
process validation can be performed in a traditional way, regardless of the chosen 
development approach.
manufacturing processes applying the traditional approach shall undergo a prospective 
validation program, prior to product approval.
however, as an alternative, continuous process verification can be applied for products 
that were developed by a qbd concept. as a prerequisite a substantial amount of 
product and process knowledge and understanding has been gained by e.g. process 
analytical technology and statistical tools such as multivariate statistical process 
control.
a combination of traditional process validation and continuous process verification 
may be applied. the in-line, on-line or at-line monitoring that is often utilized for 
continuous process verification provides substantially information and knowledge 
about the process on going and might facilitate process improvements in a faster 
manner.
a bracketing approach can be applied in the case of process validation referred to 
multiple strengths of identical or closely related formulations or different sites, if 
adequately justified.
examples include but are not limited to:

capsules of different strengths made with different fill plug sizes from the same 
powder blend,

tablets of different strengths manufactured by compressing varying amounts of 
the same granules/powder blend,

oral solutions of different strengths with formulations that differ only in minor 
excipients (e.g. colorants, flavorings) and

site transfers.
furthermore, bracketing can be applied to different container sizes or different fills in 
the same container closure system.


there have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes 
other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment 
suitability; and,

the impurity profile has been established for the existing api.
batches selected for retrospective validation must be representative of all batches

it is generally considered acceptable that a minimum of three consecutive batches per

are used and whether similar products or processes are already used at the site. an 
initial validation exercise with three consecutive batches may need to be supplemented

traditional process validation is typically performed at the end of the pharmaceutical 
development and/or process development, normally after upscaling to full production 
scale and prior to marketing of the finished product.
as part of the process validation lifecycle, some process validation studies may be 
conducted on pilot scale batches if the process has not yet been scaled up to 
production scale (e.g. in case of variations). it is important to note that pilot batch sizes 
must be representative and correspond to at least 10% of the production scale batch 
(i.e. such that the multiplication factor for the scale-up does not exceed 10). for solid 
oral dosage forms this size must generally be 10% of the maximum production scale 
or 100,000 units whichever is the greater. where the intended batch size is less than 
100,000 units, the predictive value of the pilot batches may be limited. those batches 
having a limited predictive value must be justified and followed by more predictive 
batches.
in the case of pilot batches of apis or intermediates the pilot batch size must be 
representative compared to the industrial batch size. the batch scale must be justified
with a science and risk-based approach.
since it is not generally considered useful to conduct full validation studies on pilot 
scale batches, the process validation scheme must be completed for each product for 
subsequent execution on a production scale, if justified bracketing or matrixing can be

continuous process verification can be applied as an alternative to traditional process 
validation. it may be applicable for the manufacturing of the finished product and api 
processes that were newly developed by a qbd approach, where it has been 
scientifically established during development that the applied control strategy provides 
a high degree of assurance of product quality.
the scope and extent of process verification will be influenced by a number of factors 
including:

prior development and knowledge of the manufacturing of similar products 
and/or processes.

the extent of process understanding gained during development;

development studies and commercial manufacturing experience;

the complexity of the product and/or manufacturing process;

the level of process automation and analytical technologies used (e.g. process 
analytical technology (pat));

for already established "legacy" products, the robustness of the process and 
the product understanding obtained during the product life-cycle;

risk assessment
the decision on the scope and extent of validation must be based on a justified using 
a risk-based approach of the manufacturing process.
the basis by which process parameters and quality attributes are identified as being 
critical or non-critical must be clearly documented and justified, considering the results 
of any risk assessment activities. the cpps and cqas are defined in the respective 
control strategy, which is established during stage 1 of the product lifecycle. the 
methodology for the definition of the cpps and cqas is described in the tmat-
002332.
the potential risk identified during risk analysis for any new processes/changes, 
introduced in existing processes, is mitigated by the development of an adequate risk 
mitigation plan. the detectability of possible failures during process validation is 
supported by a suitable testing and sampling plan.
based on the outcome of process validation, the risks associated with routine 
production must be re-assessed, and the results must ensure the control of the whole 
production process.

process validation may also cover primary and secondary packaging operations. 
process qualification of packaging equipment (primary and secondary) can be 
combined with process validation. minimum and maximum operating ranges defined 
for the critical process parameters such as temperature, machine speed and sealing 
pressure or for any other critical factors must be tested within lifecycle approach.

a risk-based approach of the manufacturing process.
The basis by which process parameters and quality attributes are identified as being 
critical or non-critical must be clearly documented and justified, considering the results 
of any risk assessment activities. The CPPs and CQAs are defined in the respective 
control strategy, which is established during stage 1 of the product lifecycle. The 
methodology for the definition of the CPPs and CQAs is described in the TMAT-
002332.
The potential risk identified during risk analysis for any new processes/changes, 
introduced in existing processes, is mitigated by the development of an adequate risk 
mitigation plan. The detectability of possible failures during Process Validation is 
supported by a suitable testing and sampling plan.
Based on the outcome of Process Validation, the risks associated with routine 
production must be re-assessed, and the results must ensure the control of the whole 
production process.
5.5
Validation of Packaging
Process Validation may also cover primary and secondary packaging operations. 
Process Qualification of packaging equipment (primary and secondary) can be 
combined with Process Validation. Minimum and maximum operating ranges defined 
for the critical process parameters such as temperature, machine speed and sealing 
pressure or for any other critical factors must be tested within lifecycle approach.
