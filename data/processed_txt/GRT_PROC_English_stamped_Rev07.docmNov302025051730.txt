scope
this document applies to everyone involved in the management of gxp-related 
changes within the grünenthal group. 
the process applies to the following change types:


all gvp-related changes

it infrastructure changes
(see proc-004973 “it infrastructure change 
management”)

label/text changes to printed packaging material (proc-004879 “global label 
management process”)

sap adjustments/enhancements with non-gxp impact managed via sap service 
request or via it change in the itsm system (sup-004246 “list of sap service

data integrity 
(di) 
data integrity is the degree to which data are complete, consistent, 
accurate, trustworthy, reliable and that these characteristics of the 
data are maintained throughout the data life cycle. 
the data must be collected and maintained in a secure manner, so 
that they are attributable, legible, contemporaneously recorded,

effectiveness 
check [ec]
the prove of the effectiveness of changes implemented is part of 
the change management process. 
the effectiveness check aims to confirm that the change meets its 
intended objectives and pre-defined acceptance criteria with no 
unexpected consequences.
the acceptance criteria must define:
- what to be monitored and measured (e.g., deviations/ incidents 
after the implementation)
- how to be measured (e.g., trend analysis, cpv, periodic incident 
reviews, % of deviations) 
- how many: maximum limit accepted if measurable (e.g,  less 
than 2% of new deviations)
- how long: the duration of monitoring period (e.g., monitor the 
number of deviations within 6 months after the implementation, or a 
specific number of produced batches, or based on a periodic review 
scheduled etc.)
the check of the effectiveness is mandatory for all major changes, 
but applicable to minor changes as well whenever deemed 
appropriate and beneficial.

any technical gxp-related change (cs change) that must be

moc functionalities
any meetings can be documented via the meeting minutes form if needed. the 
meeting minute functionality can be used to document meeting minutes/decisions, to 
track any additional tasks needed (e.g. collaboration or pre-activities before 
implementation) or any decision relevant for processing the change (e.g. tasks to be 
done before making a decision like data collection to support the assessment, 
definition of  the implementation strategy, notification to authorities).
anytime the functionality of the communication log can be used for notifications to 
the functions involved and/or affected by the change. for example:
perform any escalation notification
notify the update of some actions to the needed stakeholders
notify the task assignee to start  the assigned action item
5.5
business continuity
the mastercontrol system can be restored in less than 12 hours (proc-001798). this 
temporary unavailability of mastercontrol has a low risk concerning product quality, 
patient safety or other critical business. therefore, a special process for business 
continuity for change control management is not needed.
nevertheless, in case the mastercontrol system is not available for a longer time, 
quality assurance or other similar function (if qa is not available the responsible 
person of the affected area) must be contacted to discuss a paper-based 
documentation. as soon as the system has been restored, the information documented 
on paper must be completely transferred into the system by the user who is in charge 
of the process step at the time the system is recovered. the transferred information in 
the moc form must be reviewed for completeness and correctness by a second 
person. both people must sign the respective moc step in mastercontrol.

Any meetings can be documented via the Meeting Minutes form if needed. The 
meeting minute functionality can be used to document meeting minutes/decisions, to 
track any additional tasks needed (e.g. collaboration or pre-activities before 
implementation) or any decision relevant for processing the change (e.g. tasks to be 
done before making a decision like data collection to support the assessment, 
definition of  the implementation strategy, notification to authorities).
Anytime the functionality of the Communication Log can be used for notifications to 
the functions involved and/or affected by the change. For example:
perform any escalation notification
notify the update of some actions to the needed stakeholders
notify the Task assignee to start  the assigned action item

Business Continuity
The MasterControl system can be restored in less than 12 hours (PROC-001798). This 
temporary unavailability of MasterControl has a low risk concerning product quality, 
patient safety or other critical business. Therefore, a special process for business 
continuity for Change Control Management is not needed.
Nevertheless, in case the MasterControl system is not available for a longer time, 
Quality Assurance or other similar function (if QA is not available the responsible 
person of the affected area) must be contacted to discuss a paper-based 
documentation. As soon as the system has been restored, the information documented 
on paper must be completely transferred into the system by the user who is in charge 
of the process step at the time the system is recovered. The transferred information in 
the MOC form must be reviewed for completeness and correctness by a second 
person. Both people must sign the respective MOC step in MasterControl.
