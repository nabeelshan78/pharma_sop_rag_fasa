scope
this document applies to everyone involved in capa management at grünenthal
group (grt).

process
5.1
general
capas are initiated risk based. capa timelines must take into consideration the 
risk associated to the issue from which they are originated.
capas are mandatory for
-
critical and major deviations (proc-004019) 
-
justified critical and major (e.g., ras class i - ii) complaints (proc-004270)
-
confirmed audit observations and findings
-
identified critical trends in gxp processes
capas should be originated for (recommendation)
-
other identified trends
-
reviews (e.g., opportunities for improvement e.g., stand alone capa’s
-
other situations that require tracking and trending of actions and issues 
requiring short, mid and long-term monitoring and resolution
capas can be originated for
-
minor deviations, only if sufficiently reasonable and explained.
within mastercontrol (mc) one capa form is generated per issue, e.g., for a 
deviation. only for minor audit observations/ findings it is allowed to issue only one 
capa for several minor observations/ findings. 
the process starts with capa initiation and ends with final qa approval of the capa 
record (details see section 5.3.).
if a capa requires a technical or product design change, this must be managed and 
approved as a change control according to proc-007059. the capa can only be 
closed when the related change control is at least in step implementation. 
5.2
smart principles
“smart” concept is a valuable tool to facilitate effective capa management:
smart attributes
definition
specific
each capa must have its own record and workflow. it must 
be specifically defined to allow an effective improvement.
measurable
the capa plan must include appropriate action items 
resulting in measurable output.
achievable
all action items must be clearly assigned to a responsible 
person, considering, but not limited to, availability, 
qualification, and access to necessary resources.
relevant
the capa plan must be defined in relation to the real needs 
of/ situation at grt.
timely
for each capa a reasonable timeframe must be defined.

5.3.4
effectiveness checks
activities to check effectiveness are mandatory for capas initiated for critical issues. 
the ec closes the loop between the identified root cause and its correction.
whether or not to execute an effectiveness check must be described in the capa 
plan (see section 5.3.2. step 1) including 
-
who will check the effectiveness
-
what will be checked (e.g., products, processes) 
-
how data will be collected (e.g., gemba walks, audits, assessments, metrics, 
interviews, process observations, technical measurements, metrics, 
verification/validation reports)
-
the time period for data collection to ensure sufficient time for evaluation 
based on statistical probability of re-occurrence of the root cause
-
criteria to be fulfilled in order to define if the capa was effective
an effectiveness check might not be required when it can be shown that the root 
cause was sufficiently addressed immediately.

timelines/overall due date
capas are assigned an overall due date that covers the time required to complete all 
steps of the workflow. due dates of individual action items cannot be adjusted and 
the respective action is counted as overdue once the defined due date is exceeded. 
the capa overall due date can be adjusted by the capa owner during capa plan 
development and before sign-off, as no action items for corrective and preventive 
actions are launched at that time. 
if during the implementation phase or effectiveness check completion, the capa 
owner identifies that the capa overall due date cannot be met, this must be 
addressed to the affected management and qa in order to define appropriate 
measures.

5.5
trend analysis
a regular trend analysis of capas related to gxp must be performed by quality 
assurance at least on a quarterly basis. the outcome of that regular trend analysis 
must be shared with the affected management, e.g., in the frame of periodical 
management review in order to define suitable actions if required.
5.6
business continuity
the mastercontrol system can be restored in less than 12 hours (proc-001798). 
this temporary unavailability of mastercontrol has a low risk concerning product 
quality, patient safety or other critical business. therefore, a special process for 
business continuity for capa management is not needed.
nevertheless, in case mc system is not available for a longer time, quality 
assurance or other similar function (if qa is not available the responsible person of 
the affected area) must be contacted to discuss a paper-based documentation. as 
soon as the system has been restored, the information documented on paper must 
be completely transferred into the system by the user who is in charge of the process 
step at the time the system is recovered. the transferred information in the capa 
form must be reviewed for completeness and correctness by a second person. both 
persons must sign the respective step in mc.
